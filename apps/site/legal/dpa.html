    <h1 class="text-3xl font-extrabold">Data Processing Addendum (DPA)</h1>
    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
      This Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”) forms part of and is subject to the Orbitcheck Terms of Service or other
      written agreement governing your use of the Services (the “Agreement”) between Orbitcheck (“Processor”) and the
      customer entity identified in the Agreement (“Controller”). This DPA applies to Processor’s Processing of Personal
      Data on behalf of Controller in connection with the Services. In case of conflict between this DPA and the
      Agreement, this DPA prevails to the extent of the conflict. Capitalized terms not defined in this DPA have the
      meanings in the Agreement.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      If you require a countersigned copy of this DPA, contact <a href="mailto:dpa@orbitcheck.io"
        class="text-indigo-700 hover:underline">dpa@orbitcheck.io</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="definitions" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">1. Definitions</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700"><strong>“Data Protection Laws”</strong> means all laws and regulations applicable to
      the Processing of Personal Data under the Agreement, including as applicable: the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR and UK Data
      Protection Act 2018, the Swiss FADP, and U.S. state privacy laws such as the CCPA/CPRA (collectively, “Applicable
      Laws”).</p>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700"><strong>“EU GDPR”</strong> means Regulation (EU) 2016/679; <strong>“UK GDPR”</strong>
      has the meaning in the UK Data Protection Act 2018; <strong>“FADP”</strong> means the Swiss Federal Act on Data
      Protection; <strong>“CCPA/CPRA”</strong> means California Civil Code §1798.100 et seq., as amended.</p>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700"><strong>“Personal Data”</strong> means any information relating to an identified or
      identifiable natural person that Processor Processes on behalf of Controller in connection with the Services.</p>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700"><strong>“Processing”</strong> means any operation performed on Personal Data,
      including collection, validation, normalization, deduplication, enrichment, storage, caching, retrieval,
      disclosure, or deletion.</p>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700"><strong>“Services”</strong> means Orbitcheck’s data validation, deduplication, entity
      resolution, and risk-driven order control services and related APIs, SDKs, connectors, dashboards, and support.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700"><strong>“Subprocessor”</strong> means any third party engaged by Processor to Process
      Personal Data on behalf of Controller.</p>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700"><strong>“SCCs”</strong> means the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses
      for the transfer of personal data to third countries (Module Two: Controller to Processor), and any UK and Swiss
      addenda or equivalents, each as updated or replaced from time to time.</p>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700"><strong>“Security Incident”</strong> means a breach of Processor’s security leading to
      the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Personal Data
      transmitted, stored or otherwise Processed by Processor.</p>

    <h2 id="scope" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">2. Scope, Instructions, and Purpose</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      Processor will Process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Controller, including as necessary to
      provide, maintain, secure, and improve the Services, to comply with law, and as otherwise set out in this DPA and
      the Agreement. The subject-matter, nature, purpose, duration, categories of Personal Data, and Data Subjects are
      described in Annex I. Processor will notify Controller if, in Processor’s opinion, an instruction infringes
      Applicable Laws (to the extent legally permitted).
    </p>

    <h2 id="roles" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">3. Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      Controller determines the purposes and means of Processing. Controller is responsible for (a) ensuring it has a
      lawful basis and appropriate transparency notices for the Processing; (b) providing accurate, relevant, and
      minimized data; and (c) not submitting Prohibited Data (see Section 14). Processor acts as a processor/service
      provider/contractor and will not “sell” or “share” Personal Data (as those terms are defined by the CCPA/CPRA) or
      otherwise Process Personal Data for advertising, profiling, or purposes other than providing the Services, except
      as permitted by Applicable Laws or this DPA.
    </p>

    <h2 id="confidentiality" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">4. Confidentiality and Personnel</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      Processor ensures that persons authorized to Process Personal Data are bound by confidentiality obligations and
      receive appropriate privacy and security training. Processor will limit access to Personal Data to personnel who
      need such access to provide the Services.
    </p>

    <h2 id="security" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">5. Security Measures</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      Processor implements and maintains appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data,
      taking into account the nature of Processing and the risks involved. These measures include encryption in transit
      and at rest, access controls and least privilege, multi-factor authentication for administrative access, network
      and application security, logging and monitoring, vulnerability and patch management, secure software development
      practices, business continuity and disaster recovery, and vendor risk management, as further described in Annex
      II. Processor may update security measures from time to time provided the overall level of protection is not
      materially diminished.
    </p>

    <h2 id="breach" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">6. Security Incidents</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      Processor will notify Controller without undue delay (and in any case within 72 hours after confirmation) upon
      becoming aware of a Security Incident affecting Personal Data, and will provide information reasonably available
      about the nature of the incident, the categories and approximate number of Data Subjects and records concerned,
      likely consequences, and measures taken or proposed to address the incident. Processor will take reasonable steps
      to mitigate adverse effects and will cooperate with Controller’s reasonable requests, taking into account
      Processor’s obligations to law enforcement and confidentiality.
    </p>

    <h2 id="dsr" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">7. Data Subject Requests and Assistance</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      Taking into account the nature of the Processing, Processor will assist Controller by appropriate technical and
      organizational measures, insofar as possible, to respond to requests to exercise rights under Applicable Laws
      (e.g., access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, objection). If Processor receives a request
      directly from a Data Subject, Processor will, unless prohibited by law, direct the Data Subject to submit the
      request to Controller.
    </p>

    <h2 id="dpia" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">8. DPIAs and Regulatory Cooperation</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      Processor will provide reasonable assistance to Controller with data protection impact assessments, prior
      consultations with supervisory authorities, and security assessments required by Applicable Laws, in each case
      solely in relation to the Processing of Personal Data by Processor and taking into account the nature of the
      Processing and information available to Processor.
    </p>

    <h2 id="subprocessors" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">9. Subprocessors</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      Controller authorizes Processor to engage Subprocessors to support the Services. A current list is available at
      <a href="/subprocessors" class="text-indigo-700 hover:underline">orbitcheck.io/subprocessors</a> (“Subprocessor
      List”). Processor will impose data protection obligations on Subprocessors that are no less protective than those
      in this DPA and remains responsible for Subprocessors’ performance. Processor will provide notice of new
      Subprocessors by updating the Subprocessor List and, where legally required, via email subscription. Controller
      may object to a new Subprocessor on reasonable data protection grounds within 15 days of notice; if unresolved,
      Controller may terminate the affected Services without penalty as its sole and exclusive remedy.
    </p>

    <h2 id="transfers" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">10. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      Processor may Process Personal Data globally, including outside the EEA/UK/Switzerland, subject to appropriate
      transfer mechanisms. Where Personal Data is transferred to a third country that does not ensure an adequate level
      of protection, the parties agree that the SCCs (Module Two: Controller to Processor), as incorporated by reference
      and completed by Annex I and Annex II of this DPA, will apply, together with the UK International Data Transfer
      Addendum and Swiss addendum as applicable. For clarity, the SCCs and applicable addenda prevail in the event of
      conflict with this DPA. Data residency options may be available for eligible plans.
    </p>

    <h2 id="retention" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">11. Retention, Return, and Deletion</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      Processor retains Personal Data only for as long as necessary to provide the Services, to comply with the
      Agreement and Applicable Laws, and as described in Annex I (e.g., by plan configuration, typically between 7 and
      365 days). Upon termination or upon Controller’s written request, Processor will delete or return Personal Data
      (at Controller’s election) and delete existing copies within a reasonable period, unless retention is required by
      law. Deletion of data in backups will occur in the ordinary course of backup rotation.
    </p>

    <h2 id="audit" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">12. Audits and Information</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      Processor will make available to Controller information necessary to demonstrate compliance with this DPA and,
      upon reasonable advance notice no more than once per year (unless required by a supervisory authority or following
      a Security Incident), allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by Controller or an
      independent auditor mandated by Controller, subject to confidentiality and security requirements. Processor may
      satisfy audit requests by providing third-party audit reports, certifications, or summaries of penetration tests,
      where available.
    </p>

    <h2 id="gov-requests" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">13. Government and Third-Party Requests</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      If a government, law enforcement, or third party requests access to Personal Data, Processor will (i) notify
      Controller promptly unless legally prohibited, (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to redirect the request to
      Controller, and (iii) disclose only the minimum necessary to comply with the request after assessing its legality.
    </p>

    <h2 id="ccpa" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">14. California (CCPA/CPRA) Terms</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      To the extent the CCPA/CPRA applies, Processor acts as Controller’s “service provider” and/or “contractor.”
      Processor will not: (a) sell or share Personal Information; (b) retain, use, or disclose Personal Information for
      any purpose other than the business purposes specified in the Agreement, this DPA, or as permitted by the
      CCPA/CPRA; (c) combine Personal Information with personal information that Processor receives from another source,
      except as permitted by the CCPA/CPRA to provide the Services. Processor certifies that it understands and will
      comply with these obligations and will enable Controller to comply with consumer requests.
    </p>

    <h2 id="prohibited" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">15. Prohibited Data and Controller Responsibilities</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      Unless expressly agreed in writing, Controller will not submit and Processor has no obligation to Process: (i)
      special categories of personal data under GDPR (e.g., health, biometric, genetic, racial or ethnic origin,
      religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation), (ii) precise geolocation, (iii) payment card primary
      account numbers, full bank account numbers, or credentials, (iv) government identification document scans or
      images, or (v) children’s data under the age of 16. For clarity, the Services support validation of business and
      tax identifiers expressly listed in Annex I (e.g., EU VAT IDs, ES NIF/NIE, BR CPF/CNPJ, MX RFC, AR CUIT, CL RUT,
      PE RUC/DNI) for legitimate business purposes determined by Controller. Controller is solely responsible for its
      compliance with Applicable Laws, including obtaining any required consents or notices and ensuring a lawful basis.
    </p>

    <h2 id="deidentified" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">16. De-identified and Aggregated Data</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      Processor may create and use de-identified and/or aggregated data for purposes such as analytics, benchmarking,
      and improving the Services, provided such data does not identify or reasonably relate to a specific Data Subject
      or Controller and Processor implements technical safeguards and public commitments consistent with Applicable Laws
      to prevent re-identification.
    </p>

    <h2 id="liability" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">17. Liability; Order of Precedence</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      Each party’s liability arising from or related to this DPA is subject to the limitations and exclusions of
      liability in the Agreement; provided that nothing limits either party’s liability to the extent such limitation is
      prohibited by Applicable Laws or the SCCs. In the event of conflict between: (i) this DPA and the Agreement, this
      DPA controls; (ii) this DPA and the SCCs, the SCCs control.
    </p>

    <h2 id="misc" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">18. Term, Governing Law, and Amendments</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      This DPA is effective for the term of the Agreement and will automatically terminate upon termination of the
      Agreement, except for provisions that by their nature survive. Governing law and venue are as set forth in the
      Agreement; where the SCCs apply, the SCCs’ governing law provisions control. Processor may update this DPA as
      required to reflect changes in law or the Services; material changes will be communicated with reasonable notice.
      Continued use of the Services after the effective date of changes constitutes acceptance.
    </p>
