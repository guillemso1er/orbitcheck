    <h1 class="text-3xl font-extrabold">Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
      These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern access to and use of Orbicheck’s services, including APIs, SDKs,
      connectors, dashboards, websites, and related services (collectively, the “Services”) provided by Orbicheck
      (“Orbicheck,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). By creating an account, generating API keys, or using the Services, you agree
      to these Terms. If you are entering into these Terms on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent
      that you have authority to bind that entity, in which case “you” and “Customer” refer to that entity.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      If you have a separate signed agreement with Orbicheck (e.g., MSA or Order Form), that agreement governs to the
      extent of any conflict with these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">1. Definitions</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700"><strong>“Account”</strong> means your registered account used to access the Services.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700"><strong>“Customer Data”</strong> means data you or your users submit to the Services
      for validation and processing, including names, addresses, emails, phone numbers, and supported business/tax
      identifiers.</p>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700"><strong>“Results Data”</strong> means data, scores, signals, reason codes, normalized
      or deduplicated records, and other outputs generated by the Services from Customer Data.</p>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700"><strong>“Documentation”</strong> means product and API documentation, usage guides,
      and policies provided by Orbicheck.</p>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700"><strong>“Order”</strong> means an online purchase, plan selection, or executed order
      form that references these Terms.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">2. Accounts and Access</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 text-gray-700">
      <li>You must provide accurate account information and keep it updated. You must be at least 18 years old (or the
        age of majority in your jurisdiction) to use the Services.</li>
      <li>You are responsible for safeguarding API keys, credentials, and access controls. Do not share keys outside
        your organization. Rotate keys promptly if you suspect compromise.</li>
      <li>You are responsible for activities under your Account. Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use at <a
          href="mailto:security@orbicheck.io" class="text-indigo-700 hover:underline">security@orbicheck.io</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">3. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      You will use the Services only in accordance with the Documentation and applicable law. You will not:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 text-gray-700">
      <li>Violate laws or third-party rights (including privacy, export, and sanctions laws).</li>
      <li>Submit Prohibited Data (see Section 7) or use the Services for unlawful, discriminatory, or automated
        decisions that have legal or similarly significant effects without appropriate safeguards.</li>
      <li>Bypass or interfere with security, rate limits, or service integrity; load-test or probe without written
        authorization.</li>
      <li>Misuse registries or data sources accessed by the Services (e.g., scraping beyond permitted use, reselling raw
        registry data).</li>
      <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or create a substitute or competing service using the Services or Results Data,
        except to the extent such restriction is prohibited by law.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      Fair Use and Rate Limits: Usage is subject to plan limits and technical constraints described in the
      Documentation. We may throttle or suspend abusive or disruptive usage to protect the Services.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">4. Fees and Billing</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 text-gray-700">
      <li><strong>Plans and Pricing</strong>: Fees are as stated at checkout or in your Order. Free tier and trials are
        as described on our site.</li>
      <li><strong>Metering and Overages</strong>: Usage may be metered (e.g., validations, API calls). Overage fees
        apply at the then-current rates and are billed monthly in arrears.</li>
      <li><strong>Invoices and Payment</strong>: Unless otherwise agreed, charges are due upon invoice or via automatic
        payment. Late amounts may incur interest at the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum allowed by law, plus
        reasonable collection costs.</li>
      <li><strong>Taxes</strong>: Fees exclude taxes. You are responsible for applicable taxes, duties, and government
        charges, excluding taxes based on our net income.</li>
      <li><strong>Refunds</strong>: Except as required by law or expressly stated (e.g., any posted satisfaction
        guarantee terms), fees are non-refundable.</li>
      <li><strong>Price Changes</strong>: We may change fees or introduce new charges with reasonable prior notice.
        Changes take effect in the next billing cycle or upon renewal unless otherwise agreed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">5. Services; Changes; Beta</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 text-gray-700">
      <li><strong>Service Availability</strong>: We strive for high availability but do not guarantee uninterrupted
        operation. External data sources (e.g., VIES or national tax registries) are outside our control.</li>
      <li><strong>Modifications</strong>: We may modify features, Documentation, or components to improve or maintain
        the Services. Material changes will be communicated with reasonable notice.</li>
      <li><strong>Beta/Pre-release</strong>: We may offer preview or beta features (“Beta”) for evaluation. Beta is
        provided “as is,” may change or be discontinued at any time, and is excluded from any SLAs or warranties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">6. Data Protection and Security</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      We process Customer Data as your processor/service provider in accordance with the <a href="/dpa"
        class="text-indigo-700 hover:underline">Data Processing Addendum (DPA)</a>. Our security measures are described
      in the DPA (Annex II). Our <a href="/privacy" class="text-indigo-700 hover:underline">Privacy Policy</a> explains
      how we process personal data as a controller (e.g., for our website, account administration, and marketing).
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">7. Customer Data; Prohibited Data</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 text-gray-700">
      <li><strong>Ownership</strong>: Between the parties, you own Customer Data. You grant Orbicheck a limited,
        worldwide, non-exclusive license to process Customer Data to provide and improve the Services, and to generate
        Results Data.</li>
      <li><strong>Results Data</strong>: We own the Services and methods used to generate Results Data. Subject to these
        Terms and your plan limits, we grant you a non-exclusive, worldwide license to use Results Data for your
        internal business purposes.</li>
      <li><strong>Prohibited Data</strong>: Unless we expressly agree in writing, do not submit special categories of
        data (e.g., health, biometric, genetic), precise geolocation, payment card primary account numbers, full bank
        details or credentials, government ID images, or children’s data. The Services support validation of
        business/tax identifiers as documented (e.g., EU VAT, ES NIF/NIE, BR CPF/CNPJ, MX RFC, AR CUIT, CL RUT, PE
        RUC/DNI).</li>
      <li><strong>De-identified/Aggregated Use</strong>: We may use de-identified or aggregated data for analytics and
        service improvement, provided it does not identify you or individuals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">8. Third-Party Services and Integrations</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      The Services may interoperate with third-party platforms (e.g., Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce, Magento) and
      public registries. Your use of third-party services is governed by their terms. We are not responsible for
      third-party services or for their availability, accuracy, or security.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">9. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      Each party will protect the other’s non-public information using at least reasonable care and use it only to
      perform under these Terms. Confidentiality obligations do not apply to information that is publicly available,
      rightfully received from a third party, independently developed, or required to be disclosed by law (with notice
      where legally permitted).
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">10. Intellectual Property; Feedback</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 text-gray-700">
      <li>The Services, Documentation, and all related IP are owned by Orbicheck and its licensors. No rights are
        granted except as expressly stated.</li>
      <li>You will not remove or obscure proprietary notices, nor use Orbicheck’s marks without written permission. We
        may use your name and logo to identify you as a customer unless you opt out by emailing <a
          href="mailto:legal@orbicheck.io" class="text-indigo-700 hover:underline">legal@orbicheck.io</a>.</li>
      <li>If you provide feedback or suggestions, you grant us a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license
        to use it without restriction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">11. Compliance; Export; High-Risk Use</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 text-gray-700">
      <li>You are responsible for complying with laws applicable to your use of the Services and Customer Data,
        including obtaining required consents and providing notices.</li>
      <li>You will not use the Services in violation of export controls or sanctions. You represent that you are not
        located in, organized under the laws of, or ordinarily resident in any embargoed jurisdiction and are not on any
        restricted party list.</li>
      <li>The Services are not designed for medical, life-support, or other high-risk activities where failure could
        result in death, personal injury, or environmental damage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">12. Warranties; Disclaimers</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 text-gray-700">
      <li>We warrant that we will provide the Services in a professional and workmanlike manner consistent with the
        Documentation.</li>
      <li>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED, THE SERVICES, RESULTS DATA, AND BETA ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” WE
        DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND
        NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED, OR THAT EXTERNAL
        REGISTRIES WILL BE AVAILABLE OR ACCURATE.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">13. Indemnification</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 text-gray-700">
      <li><strong>By Customer</strong>: You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Orbicheck from claims, damages,
        liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from (a) your Customer Data or
        use of the Services in violation of these Terms or law; (b) your breach of Section 3, 7, or 11; or (c) your use
        of third-party services.</li>
      <li><strong>By Orbicheck</strong>: We will defend you against third-party claims alleging that the Services, as
        provided by us and used by you per the Documentation, infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights, and
        we will pay damages and costs finally awarded or agreed in settlement. If such a claim arises, we may, at our
        option, procure rights for continued use, modify the Services to be non-infringing, or terminate the affected
        Services and refund prepaid unused fees. This obligation does not apply to claims arising from combinations with
        non-Orbicheck products, modifications not made by us, or use in breach of these Terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">14. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 text-gray-700">
      <li>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
        CONSEQUENTIAL, COVER, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL, EVEN IF ADVISED
        OF THE POSSIBILITY.</li>
      <li>EXCEPT FOR YOUR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS, EACH PARTY’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS
        WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID OR PAYABLE BY YOU TO ORBICHECK FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM IN THE
        12 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.</li>
      <li>The limitations in this Section apply to all causes of action, whether in contract, tort (including
        negligence), strict liability, or otherwise, and to the fullest extent permitted by law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">15. Term; Suspension; Termination</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 text-gray-700">
      <li><strong>Term</strong>: These Terms apply from the earlier of your account creation or first use of the
        Services and continue until terminated.</li>
      <li><strong>Suspension</strong>: We may suspend or limit the Services immediately if necessary to address a
        security threat, prevent harm, comply with law, or for non-payment.</li>
      <li><strong>Termination by You</strong>: You may cancel your plan or terminate your Account at any time via the
        dashboard or by notice to us. Fees already paid are non-refundable unless required by law or expressly stated.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Termination for Cause</strong>: Either party may terminate on written notice if the other party
        materially breaches these Terms and does not cure within 30 days of notice.</li>
      <li><strong>Effect</strong>: Upon termination, your right to access the Services ends. At your request within 30
        days, we will make available an export of Customer Data and Results Data then in our possession, subject to our
        data retention and deletion schedules. Sections that by their nature should survive (including 6–14 and 17–20)
        will survive termination.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">16. Government and Lawful Requests</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      We may disclose information as required by law, regulation, or legal process. Where legally permitted, we will
      notify you of requests relating to your Customer Data and seek to redirect requestors to you.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">17. Force Majeure</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      Neither party is liable for delays or failures caused by events beyond its reasonable control, including acts of
      God, labor disputes, supply shortages, war, terrorism, governmental action, utility or Internet disturbances, or
      failures of third-party services.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">18. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      We may update these Terms to reflect changes in the Services or applicable law. If we make material changes, we
      will provide reasonable notice (e.g., in-app notice or email). The revised Terms will be effective on the stated
      effective date. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">19. Governing Law; Venue</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      These Terms are governed by the laws of [Jurisdiction, e.g., Ireland / England and Wales / Delaware], excluding
      conflict of laws rules. The parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in
      [Jurisdiction], unless otherwise set out in a signed agreement. The U.N. Convention on Contracts for the
      International Sale of Goods does not apply.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">20. Miscellaneous</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 text-gray-700">
      <li><strong>Order of Precedence</strong>: In case of conflict, an executed Order or MSA prevails over these Terms;
        the DPA controls for data protection matters; Documentation controls for technical limits.</li>
      <li><strong>Assignment</strong>: You may not assign these Terms without our consent, except to an affiliate or in
        connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets with notice to us. We may assign to an affiliate or in
        connection with corporate transactions.</li>
      <li><strong>Notices</strong>: Legal notices to Orbicheck must be sent to <a href="mailto:legal@orbicheck.io"
          class="text-indigo-700 hover:underline">legal@orbicheck.io</a>. We may provide notices to you via email to
        your Account email or in-product notifications.</li>
      <li><strong>Severability; Waiver</strong>: If any provision is unenforceable, it will be modified to the minimum
        extent necessary, and the remainder will remain in effect. Failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver.</li>
      <li><strong>Entire Agreement</strong>: These Terms, any Orders, the DPA, and referenced policies constitute the
        entire agreement regarding the Services.</li>
    </ul>
