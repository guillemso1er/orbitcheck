      <h1 class="text-3xl font-extrabold">Terms of Service</h1>
      <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern access to and use of
        Orbitcheck's services, including APIs, SDKs, connectors, dashboards,
        websites, and related services (collectively, the "Services") provided
        by Orbitcheck ("Orbitcheck," "we," "us," or "our"). By creating an
        account, generating API keys, or using the Services, you agree to these
        Terms. If you are entering into these Terms on behalf of a company or
        other legal entity, you represent that you have authority to bind that
        entity, in which case "you" and "Customer" refer to that entity.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        If you have a separate signed agreement with Orbitcheck (e.g., MSA or
        Order Form), that agreement governs to the extent of any conflict with
        these Terms.
      </p>
