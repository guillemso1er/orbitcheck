description: >
  Initiates a comprehensive data erasure process for GDPR/CCPA compliance. Permanently deletes
  all project-related data including event logs, API keys, webhooks, settings, background jobs,
  personal access tokens, and audit logs. The user's account information is anonymized by
  replacing email and password with placeholder values. A confirmation email is sent to the
  user upon successful completion of the erasure process.
